# Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-06`
- **Start Time**: `21:23`
- **End Time**: `21:55`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:32`
- **Working Title**: Pages project discovery
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `PG-001`, `PG-002`

## Objectives
- Primary goal(s) for this session:
  - Audit the legacy HTML assets (`interactive_floorplan.html`, `sensors.html`) and confirm required data/bridge layers.
  - Evaluate current Vite entrypoint setup to determine best approach for multi-page or routed integration.
  - Draft the scope for “Phase 1” of the pages project (target endpoints, shared components, data sources).

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands):
  - `sensors.html`, `src/pages/sensors/main.js`, `src/pages/sensors/sensors.css`
  - `src/lib/SensorDashboard.js`, `src/lib/PanelBuilder.js`
  - `vite.config.js`
- Key changes made:
  - Introduced a dedicated multi-page Vite entry (`sensors.html`) backed by the existing `DataPipeline`, complete with live status indicator, refresh control, and category summaries.
  - Refactored `SensorDashboard` so it can be reused outside the 3D overlay—page layout tweaks, category summaries, and filtered entries now live in the class.
  - Updated the panel overflow CTA to launch the new sensors page and wired the build config to emit both `index.html` and `sensors.html`.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - Manual sanity: `npm run dev` (load `/sensors.html`, verify live updates + link from overflow card). No automated tests run.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - `Re-use SensorDashboard logic → refactored into shareable component with page-specific styling`
  - `Multi-page build instead of router → keeps 3D shell untouched while delivering standalone dashboard`
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Existing overlay styles were too opinionated (fixed positioning); isolating CSS in `src/pages/sensors/sensors.css` keeps experiences from colliding.
  - The DataPipeline tagging work from DP-101b paid off immediately—room context appears automatically in the new view.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Polish summary metrics (e.g., average temps per category) and add deep links back into the 3D scene.
  - Mirror this structure for the interactive floorplan page (PG-003).
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Alignment on final dashboard design expectations for sensors/interactive view.
