# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `15:20`
- **End Time**: `15:30`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:10`
- **Working Title**: `Deployment project kickoff`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `DP-101`, `DP-102`

## Objectives
- Spin up a dedicated deployment project for Vercel + chunking tasks.
- Seed the backlog with the first wave of work (Vercel bootstrap, chunk strategy, env handling).

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `agents-docs/templates/project-template` → duplicated into `agents-docs/projects/deployment`.
- Authored project charter covering CI/CD scope, chunking, env management.
- Added backlog tasks DP-101…DP-105, each listing the required research keywords per process.
- Logged this setup session for traceability.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Keep deployment IDs prefixed `DP-` (mirrors data-pipeline naming expectations).
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Rolling chunk strategy into deployment keeps perf and hosting decisions coupled—good for future audits.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Begin DP-101 (Vercel setup) so we can wire preview URLs.
  - Draft manual chunk proposal (DP-102) ahead of WebGPU refactors.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need DNS + secret ownership sign-off before going live.

## Session Quote
- > "If deployment isn’t a first-class project, it becomes everyone’s last-minute fire drill."
