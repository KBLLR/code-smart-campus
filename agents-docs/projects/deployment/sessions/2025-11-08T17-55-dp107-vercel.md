## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 17:30
- **End Time**: 17:55
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:25
- **Working Title**: DP-107 Vercel automation
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: DP-107

## Objectives
- Ship repo-level Vercel configuration so anyone can deploy preview/prod builds with one command.
- Document the workflow inside README + task ledger.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `package.json`, `vercel.json`, `README.md`, `agents-docs/projects/deployment/tasks.md`.
- Key changes made:
  - Added `vercel.json` with build command, output dir, and SPA rewrites for `/sensors` + `/`.
  - Wired `npm run deploy:link|preview|prod` scripts (CLI already installed globally) and documented usage in README.
  - Logged DP-107 as done in the deployment ledger.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `npm run lint` (earlier from LD-103 context; config-only change afterwards)

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. `npm install --save-dev vercel` failed due to sandboxed DNS; documented reliance on globally installed CLI instead.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Keep CLI as an external binary → avoids blocked npm install until network approvals exist.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - CLI scripts can still reference `vercel` without local dep as long as the tool is on PATH; worth revisiting when network opens up.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - DP-101 still needs the actual Vercel project + secrets; scripts assume `vercel link` has been run.
  - Begin DP-102 chunking once `createLabel.js` task (DP-106) kicks off.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Network restrictions prevent adding Vercel as devDependency for now.
