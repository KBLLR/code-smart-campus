    title: "Audit and improve sensors.html dashboard"
    description: |
      Review http://localhost:5173/sensors.html for data presentation improvements:
      - Enhance sensor data display beyond basic state values (add context, descriptions, locations)
      - Improve category organization and visual hierarchy (currently: scheduling, occupancy, environment, lighting, energy, people, global)
      - Add search/filter functionality for sensor discovery
      - Improve data formatting (timestamps, boolean states, units)
      - Consider room/floor grouping in addition to category filtering
      - Test responsive layout on mobile/tablet
      - Add loading states and error handling UI

    title: "Audit .hui-panel styles for responsive breakpoints"
    description: |
      Review all .hui-panel, .panel-strip, and sensor panel cards for responsive behavior.
      Test on mobile (320-480px), tablet (768-1024px), desktop (1280px+).
      Fix horizontal scroll issues, card overflow, panel indicator alignment.

    title: "Create CSS design tokens and variables"
    description: |
      Establish design system with CSS variables for:
      - Color palette (bg, surface, text, accent, error, success)
      - Spacing scale (4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
      - Typography scale (h1-h6, body, monospace)
      - Component tokens (borders, shadows, radii)
      Consolidate duplicate values across main.css.

    title: "Add Escape key to close sensor panel"
    description: |
      Sensor panel currently closes on click-outside (✅ fixed in main.js:1875-1888).
      Add Escape key listener for accessibility.
      Ensure keyboard navigation works for panel controls.

      Audit and document:
      - Button variants (primary, secondary, ghost)
      - Card styles (elevated, flat, outlined)
      - Input fields (text, select, checkbox)
      - Modal/panel patterns
      Identify inconsistencies (hui-panel vs panel-shell naming).
      Create component catalog.
