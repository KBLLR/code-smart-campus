# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `09:55`
- **End Time**: `10:09`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:14`
- **Working Title**: `UG-103 Tweakpane audit`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-103`

## Objectives
- Locate every Tweakpane touchpoint and outline the removal path before adding more UIL controls.
- Document the findings in the research folder so future migrations (including WebGPU/TSL) stay aligned.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `src/debug/Debugger*.js`, `src/main.js`, `src/Setup.js`, `src/styles/main.css`.
- Key changes:
  - Logged all Tweakpane usages and CSS selectors in `research/UG-103-removal-plan.md` with a step-by-step replacement plan (Debugger refactor, keyboard toggles, dependency cleanup).
  - Updated `tasks.md` to mark UG-103 as in-progress with an explicit owner.
- Tests / commands: _not run_ (planning session only).

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Remove `DebuggerB.js` entirely once UIL debugger modules exist—no need to keep both variants.
  - Delay further UIL panel additions until the Tweakpane removal plan is underway to avoid double work.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - `Setup.js` still imports Pane but no longer uses it, so the removal is lower risk than expected.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Implement UIL-based debugger modules mirroring the object picker + orbit controls.
  - Once feature parity achieved, drop the Tweakpane packages and CSS selectors.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need to ensure StatsGL covers FPS monitoring before deleting the Tweakpane graph.
