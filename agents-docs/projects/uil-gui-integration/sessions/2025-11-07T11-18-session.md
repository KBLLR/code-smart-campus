# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `11:05`
- **End Time**: `11:18`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:13`
- **Working Title**: `UG-104 UIL column regroup`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-104`

## Objectives
- Respond to feedback by collapsing the UIL surface back into a single left column (matching the original plan) before layering in more advanced widgets.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands): `index.html`, `src/styles/main.css`, `src/main.js`.
- Key changes made:
  - Replaced the temporary dual-root layout with a single `#uil-root`, removing the right-rail CSS and secondary controller.
  - All modules (navigation, orbit/debug, lighting/post FX, sun palette, levels, debugger picker) now register on the same controller, stacked under the hero.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `npm run test:sun`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Keep the stacked column for now so we can experiment with joystick/dial widgets without layout churn.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - The single controller simplifies module registration; we can still theme individual folders later if needed.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Implement joystick/knob controls from the UIL demo within this column.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None.
