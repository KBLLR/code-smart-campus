# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `14:50`
- **End Time**: `15:07`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:17`
- **Working Title**: `UG-104 visibility heuristics`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-104`

## Objectives
- Surface UIL panel diagnostics in the console (not hidden in `console.debug`).
- Auto-switch to the new camera fallback whenever anchor-based positions land outside the camera frustum.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `src/ui/modules/CanvasUILPanels.js`, `src/main.js`.
- Swapped `console.debug` for `console.log/warn` so stakeholders see anchor bounds + per-panel placement without changing console filters.
- Added frustum/distance checks; if an anchor-derived position would render off-screen, the system now warns and pivots to the camera placement automatically.
- Exposed `window.canvasPanels` (dev only) for manual inspection and logged when the instance is ready.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Use a simple projection test instead of full frustum planes for now—fast enough for two panels.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Chrome hides `console.debug` by default for some users, so important telemetry should use `log/warn`.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Ask stakeholders to screenshot the new logs so we can tell whether anchor or fallback logic is active.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need confirmation that the fallback actually renders on their device.

## Session Quote
