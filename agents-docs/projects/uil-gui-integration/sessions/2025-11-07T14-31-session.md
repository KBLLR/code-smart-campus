# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `14:24`
- **End Time**: `14:31`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:07`
- **Working Title**: `UG-104 panel verification`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-104`

## Objectives
- Confirm whether the in-scene UIL panels appear for the latest build.
- Capture any discrepancies between local results and stakeholder feedback.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `src/ui/modules/CanvasUILPanels.js`, app runtime in Vite dev server.
- Observed that the user still cannot see the floating navigation/lighting controls even after the bounding-box placement update; likely the meshes remain behind geometry or never become visible because `roundedRoomsGroup` is missing in their repro.
- No additional code changes yet—logged the issue and planned a deeper instrumentation pass (helpers, fallback positioning, render-order tweaks) before touching more modules.
- Commands executed: `git status -sb` (context check).

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. Feature still invisible in the stakeholder environment despite local success; indicates our placement logic is brittle or depends on scene readiness assumptions.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Pause new module work until panel visibility is bulletproof across environments.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Relying solely on bounding boxes is not enough; we need a camera-relative safety net plus stronger logging so others can self-diagnose.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Add verbose console traces + helper meshes that render regardless of depth to validate placement remotely.
  - Provide a temporary camera-space anchor so panels are guaranteed visible even if the floorplan group fails to load.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need confirmation whether `roundedRoomsGroup` is ready before UIL initialises in the reported environment.
