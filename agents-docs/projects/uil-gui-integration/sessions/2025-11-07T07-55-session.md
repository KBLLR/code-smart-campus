# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `07:45`
- **End Time**: `07:55`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:10`
- **Working Title**: `UG-104 UIL layout pass`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-104`

## Objectives
- Mount UIL to a dedicated root so it no longer hides behind the hero header.
- Style the root with fixed positioning/z-index to match the intended right-side rail.
- Pre-initialise `uilController` with the mount + theme before registering modules.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `index.html`, `src/styles/main.css`, `src/main.js`.
- Key changes:
  - Added `<div id="uil-root">` inside `#ui-shell` and styled it with `position: fixed; right: 1.5rem; top: 7rem; z-index: 40`.
  - Ensured UIL container (`.uil-js`) inherits pointer events so controls are clickable.
  - Call `uilController.init({ mount: uilRoot, width: 280, theme: { accent: "#2dd4bf" } })` before registering navigation controls so UIL attaches to the new root.
- Tests / commands executed: _not run_ (CSS/DOM-only change).

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Mount UIL inside `#ui-shell` to keep all UI surfaces layered above the canvas but below HUD overlays.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - UIL respects the provided `parent` option, so repositioning only required CSS adjustments.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Add layout hooks for additional rails (bottom/left) once more modules are ready.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need final UX direction on whether sensors/rooms get their own UIL roots or share the main column.
