# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-08`
- **Start Time**: `01:20`
- **End Time**: `01:59`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:39`
- **Working Title**: `UIL projector panel`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-104`, `WR-008`

## Objectives
- Get the projector controls visible and usable under WebGPU regardless of initialization order.

## Execution Notes
- Removed the guard that hid the projector module when the projector light wasn’t ready; the module now renders with default values immediately and updates once the `projector-ready` event fires.
- Added joystick + smaller knob layouts to match UIL examples, plus new API hooks (`setPosition`) on `WebGPUProjector` so the joystick can reposition the light.
- Logging now confirms when the module registers: `[UIL] Projector controls registered (waiting for light).`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None after reorganizing the module.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Keep the module always visible so QA can see the available WebGPU controls even before conditions are met.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - UIL lacks a “text” control; status copy had to be removed to avoid blank entries.

## Next Actions
- Feed live sensor overlays into the projector once WR-009/010 land.

## Session Quote
- > “A control panel that only appears after everything is ready is no control panel at all.”

## Post Image Prompt
