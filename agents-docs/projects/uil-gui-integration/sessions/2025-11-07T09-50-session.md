# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `09:48`
- **End Time**: `09:50`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:02`
- **Working Title**: `UG-104 stacked rails`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-104`

## Objectives
- Temporarily place both UIL panels on the left rail to keep them in view until the right-side layout is finalized.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `index.html`, `src/styles/main.css`.
- Key changes:
  - Assigned the right-hand controller to the same left-rail class and added a `uil-root--stacked` helper for vertical offset.
  - Ensures navigation and lighting panels stack vertically on the left so nothing renders off-canvas.
- Tests / commands executed: _not run_ (CSS tweak only).

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Stacking is a temporary solution until a dedicated right rail layout is approved.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - UIL containers adapt cleanly to new positioning without reinitialisation.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Revisit multi-rail layout once sensor dashboard placement is final.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Awaiting UX direction on final right-rail placement.
