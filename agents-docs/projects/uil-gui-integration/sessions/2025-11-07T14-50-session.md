# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `14:35`
- **End Time**: `14:50`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:15`
- **Working Title**: `UG-104 panel fallback + instrumentation`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-104`

## Objectives
- Give stakeholders enough instrumentation to diagnose why UIL canvases remain invisible in their build.
- Ensure controls always render by adding a camera-space fallback when the room anchor is missing or invalid.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `src/ui/modules/CanvasUILPanels.js`.
- Added anchor validation + verbose console summaries (center/size + per-panel logs) so remote testers can see what transform logic is running.
- Introduced camera fallback placement: when the rounded room group is missing/invalid, panels now pin themselves a fixed distance in front of the camera and follow it each frame. Added Axes/Sphere helpers (dev builds only) to visualize the current targets.
- Cleanly disposes helpers/markers to avoid leaking meshes between hot reloads. No other files touched.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Prioritize reliability over perfect spatial alignment by defaulting to camera space; anchor-based placement still kicks in automatically when bounds are valid.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Even with depth test disabled, panels hidden inside the room hull can “feel” invisible—better to guarantee they start in front of the camera.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Have the stakeholder retest; if panels still missing, capture console output guided by the new logs.
  - Once confirmed visible, proceed with sensor/room modules.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need remote logs/screenshots to confirm which placement path is running.
