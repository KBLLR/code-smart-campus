# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `10:10`
- **End Time**: `10:23`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:13`
- **Working Title**: `UG-103 Tweakpane removal`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-103`

## Objectives
- Replace the old Tweakpane debugger with UIL-based controls.
- Remove Tweakpane dependencies/imports/CSS so future work doesn’t backslide.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `src/main.js`, `src/styles/main.css`, `src/Setup.js`, `src/ui/modules/DebuggerControls.js`, `package.json/package-lock.json`.
- Key changes:
  - Added `registerDebuggerControls` module that uses UIL to pick rooms, toggle highlights, and focus the camera; registers once `roomMeshes` are ready.
  - Removed the legacy `Debugger` class, keybindings, and DOM toggles; no more `tp-dfwv` CSS or pointer overrides.
  - Dropped `tweakpane` and `@tweakpane/plugin-essentials` (plus `@tweakpane/core`) from package manifests; `Setup.js` no longer imports Pane.
- Tests / commands executed: _not run_ (UI/dep cleanup only).

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Stacked all UIL modules on one column temporarily to avoid layout churn while Tweakpane exits.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Highlight logic was easy to port; reusing Setup’s `focusOnPoint` kept the camera control simple.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Expand debugger controls if additional tooling (FPS toggles, mesh filters) are needed.
  - Confirm ESLint/prettier configs don’t reference removed packages.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None—UIL now owns the entire control surface.
