# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `11:30`
- **End Time**: `11:48`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:18`
- **Working Title**: `UG-107 advanced widgets`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-107`, `UG-104`

## Objectives
- Bring over signature UIL widgets (joystick, knobs) so the control column visually matches the UIL demo and drives real scene behavior.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands): `src/ui/UILController.js`, `src/ui/modules/NavigationControls.js`, `src/ui/modules/LightingControls.js`.
- Key changes made:
  - Extended the shared controller to support `joystick` and `knob` control types.
  - Added a pan joystick to navigation; each input nudges the OrbitControls target/camera using camera-aligned vectors.
  - Converted bloom strength/radius sliders into UIL knobs for a more tactile look.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `npm run test:sun`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Kept joystick deltas modest (`panSpeed = 2.2`) to avoid nausea; can revisit if we add joystick acceleration later.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - UIL knobs emit immediate values with the same hooks as sliders, so the wiring stayed minimal.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Consider joystick-driven altitude (vertical pan) or a second joystick for camera roll once UX signs off.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None.
