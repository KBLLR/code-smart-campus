# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `12:32`
- **End Time**: `12:42`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:10`
- **Working Title**: `UG-107 canvas panel fix`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UG-107`

## Objectives
- Make the in-canvas UIL panels actually render/behave like the lo-th demo (previous pass created the scaffolding but nothing showed up).

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `src/ui/modules/CanvasUILPanels.js`.
- Key changes made:
  - Mount panel planes to `camera` (local z offset), disable depth testing, and force an initial `gui.draw(true)` so textures appear immediately.
  - Updated raycasting math, joystick handler, and pointer listeners so the panels react to mouse movement and temporarily disable OrbitControls while interacting.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `npm run test:sun`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None (issue was purely missing draw/placement code).
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Anchor the panel group to the camera so it’s always in view; we can later add animations if we want them floating near the campus.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - UIL canvases need a manual `draw(true)` kick for the first frame when no DOM parent is provided—worth noting for future canvas integrations.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Extend the panel set (e.g., sensors/rooms) now that the canvas pipeline works.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None.
