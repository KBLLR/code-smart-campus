# Future Features — UIL GUI Integration

Use this folder to park larger ideas that fall outside the initial migration scope. Examples:
- UIL-based macro recording and playback for scene presets.
- Collaborative control panels (multi-user editing).
- Auto-generated UIL panels from HA registry metadata.

Document each idea in its own markdown file with context, risks, and acceptance criteria before promoting it into `tasks.md`.
