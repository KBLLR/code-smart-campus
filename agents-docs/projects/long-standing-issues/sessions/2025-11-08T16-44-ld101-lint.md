# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 16:30
- **End Time**: 17:00
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:30
- **Working Title**: LD-101 lint cleanup sweep
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: LD-101

## Objectives
- Remove the unused vars/import noise blocking `pnpm run lint`
- Verify UIL modules no longer import unused controller types

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `src/data/DataPipeline.js`, `src/main.js`, `src/pages/sensors/main.js`, `src/ui/modules/*`
- Key changes made:
  - Dropped unused destructures/functions (objectId, hydrate helper, dormant DOM refs)
  - Trimmed UIL modules down to type-only references and tightened params
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **The Good**: Lint now runs cleanly for the first time since UIL migration—CI can trust `npm run check` again.
- **The Bad**: JSDoc typing forced us to duplicate import paths inline; we should adopt TS or `@typedef` shims later.
- **The Ugly**: Hunt for session template variants is getting messy; need a single source for “fun” fields soon.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Decide how to keep UIL controller types without manual inline imports (typedef or TS)
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None—LD-101 ready to close
