# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 17:20
- **End Time**: 17:45
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:25
- **Working Title**: LD-103 capability snapshot
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: LD-103

## Objectives
- Centralise renderer/feature flags in a reusable helper so UI modules stop duplicating `setup.usingWebGPU` checks.
- Surface projector/HUD/postFX availability through `scene.userData.capabilities` for future WebGPU gating.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `src/config/capabilities.js` (new), `src/main.js`, `agents-docs/projects/long-standing-issues/tasks.md`.
- Key changes made:
  - Added `buildCapabilitiesSnapshot`, `setSceneCapabilities`, and `updateSceneCapabilities` helpers and wired `main.js` to use them.
  - Snapshot now reflects renderer type, postFX, projector readiness, HUD status, and stats availability; updates fire when the projector or HUD comes online.
  - Task ledger updated to mark LD-103 as done.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **The Good**: One import now controls every feature flag, making future render-mode toggles much easier to reason about.
- **The Bad**: We still need consumers to read the structure instead of their own booleans—follow-up documentation would help.
- **The Ugly**: Deep-merge helper is simplistic; if we add arrays later we’ll need a sturdier utility.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Expose the snapshot to UIL modules (e.g., WebGPU-only panels) so they can toggle sections automatically.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None.
