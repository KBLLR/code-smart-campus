# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 17:00
- **End Time**: 17:20
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:20
- **Working Title**: LD-102 UIL lint resolution
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: LD-102

## Objectives
- Remove the last references to the vendored UIL bundle so eslint never parses third-party code.
- Document that UIL now ships from npm and add shared typedefs for downstream modules.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `src/ui/modules/*`, `src/types/uil.js`, `agents-docs/projects/3d-experience/uil-gui-plan.md`, `agents-docs/projects/uil-gui-integration/research/*`.
- Key changes made:
  - Added a central `src/types/uil.js` typedef and updated every UIL module to consume it via JSDoc instead of inline runtime imports.
  - Refreshed research/plan docs to spell out the npm-based UIL flow and removed instructions about `src/vendor/uil`.
  - Marked LD-102 complete in the long-standing issues ledger.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **The Good**: JSDoc typedef keeps the ergonomics of TS without requiring it, and eslint now has zero reason to walk 6k lines of vendor code.
- **The Bad**: Hunting down every doc reference to the vendor path was tedious—future plans should source these strings from a single glossary.
- **The Ugly**: Historical session logs still mention `src/vendor/uil.module.js`; that’s fine for provenance but may confuse newcomers unless we point them to the annex.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Consider auto-generating typedef barrels for other shared services (HUD, PostFX) to avoid drift.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None; LD-102 is closed.
