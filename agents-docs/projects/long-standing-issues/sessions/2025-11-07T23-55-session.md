# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `23:45`
- **End Time**: `23:55`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:10`
- **Working Title**: `Tech debt project kickoff`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `LD-101`, `LD-102`, `LD-103`

## Objectives
- Spin up a dedicated project for the persistent lint/legacy issues we keep deferring.

## Execution Notes
- Duplicated the project template into `agents-docs/projects/long-standing-issues/` and authored a README explaining scope (lint debt, legacy files, capability flags).
- Seeded the backlog with three initial tasks: lint cleanup, UIL vendor lint strategy, and renderer capability flags.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Track lint/reset work outside feature projects to keep status visible.
- **Learnings & Surprises**: n/a

## Next Actions
- Start LD-101 when ready; lint output in the current branch documents the failing files.

## Session Quote
- > "Tech debt ignored is tech debt compounded."

## Post Image Prompt
