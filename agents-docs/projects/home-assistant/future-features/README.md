# Future Features (Parking Lot)

Use this folder to capture longer-term ideas once the fundamentals (tunnel availability, tokens, monitoring) are stable. Examples:
- Automated tunnel failover between cloud/local HA.
- Secrets manager integration instead of `.env` files.
- Scheduled heartbeat tests with Slack/Teams alerts.

Each idea should live in its own markdown file with context, risks, and acceptance criteria.
