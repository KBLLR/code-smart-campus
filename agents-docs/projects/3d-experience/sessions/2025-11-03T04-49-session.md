# Working Session

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 04:40
- **End**: 04:49
- **Elapsed**: 00:09
- **Working title**: Project scaffold bootstrap
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `INIT-SETUP`

## Objectives
- Create the 3D Experience project workspace following the new template protocol.
- Seed the initial backlog with core feature tracks (lighting, materials, HUD).

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `docs/projects/template/` reference
- Changes made:
  - Added `docs/projects/3d-experience/README.project.md` with charter, stakeholders, dependencies.
  - Created `docs/projects/3d-experience/tasks.md` backlog aligned with planned feature tracks.
  - Added `docs/projects/3d-experience/sessions/README.md` plus this inaugural session log.
- Commands / tests:
  - `date -u` (timestamp capture)

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. Autoenv warning from shell startup (harmless, noted for future environment cleanup).
- **Decisions**:
  - Named project folder `3d-experience` to mirror the roadmap terminology and keep future automation deterministic.
- **Learnings**:
  - Housing reusable templates in `docs/templates/` accelerates new project scaffolding without copy/paste drift.

## Next Actions
- Prioritise FE-101 through FE-105 with sizing and dependencies.
- Kick off FE-101 (Sun & Moon System) by auditing current `SunController` capabilities versus roadmap needs.
