# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `21:30`
- **End Time**: `21:59`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:29`
- **Working Title**: `UIL split strategy`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-??? (to be filed)`

## Objectives
- Capture the decision to separate the UIL debugger into WebGL vs WebGPU panels so we stop shipping half-working controls when WebGPU is active.

## Execution Notes
- Reviewed current UIL modules: lighting/sun/HDR controls all assume WebGL-only features (EffectComposer, ShaderMaterials). WebGPU mode disables those systems, leaving the panel with broken sliders.
- Agreed to split the debugger into two pipelines: WebGL-only controls (bloom, sun, post FX) and WebGPU-only controls (projector, node materials, WebGPU nav).
- Action items: add new tasks on both the 3D Experience and WebGPU projects to track the separation of concerns work.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None (planning session).
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Introduce renderer-aware UIL bootstrapping so each renderer sees only the controls it can honor.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Mixing the two control sets caused a confusing UX quickly; better to gate the modules explicitly.

## Next Actions
- File tasks on 3D Experience + WebGPU projects for the renderer-specific UIL split.

## Session Quote
- > “If half the panel is dead when WebGPU is on, it’s not debugging—it’s misinformation.”

## Post Image Prompt
```
A split control deck where one side glows blue for WebGPU and the other amber for WebGL, showing only the buttons that actually work on each side.
