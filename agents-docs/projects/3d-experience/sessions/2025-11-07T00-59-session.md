# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `00:50`
- **End Time**: `01:05`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:15`
- **Working Title**: `FE-110 legacy cleanup`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-110`

## Objectives
- Remove the obsolete dashboard updater that referenced a missing `homeAssistant.js`.
- Delete the unused demo Three.js scene under `src/ui/components/atoms/`.
- Update the 3D Experience task ledger to reflect the cleanup.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `src/uiUpdater.js`, `src/ui/components/atoms/main.js`, `agents-docs/projects/3d-experience/tasks.md`.
- Key changes:
  - Deleted `src/uiUpdater.js`, eliminating the broken HA imports and unused DOM mutations.
  - Deleted `src/ui/components/atoms/main.js`, de-duplicating scene bootstrap logic.
  - Marked FE-110 as completed in the 3D Experience task ledger.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - _Not run (pure removal of unused files)._

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Removed both files outright because no modules import them and newer UI flows cover the functionality.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - There was also an empty stub at `src/ui/uiUpdater.js`—worth revisiting when auditing UI utilities.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Keep FE-110 off the backlog and ensure future HA UI hooks rely on the new sensor dashboard APIs.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None.
