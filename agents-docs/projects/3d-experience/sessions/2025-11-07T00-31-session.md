# Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `00:10`
- **End Time**: `00:31`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:21`
- **Working Title**: Gradient background + reflective ground fix
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-101b`, `FE-107`

## Objectives
- Ensure the 3D view uses the same cinematic dusk gradient as the sensors page (even after env maps load).
- Restore the reflective ground plane so the orbiting experience feels premium again.
- Lighten fog/clear colors to avoid the “black void” look users reported.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands):
  - `src/Setup.js`, `src/scene.js`
  - `npm run dev` for manual verification
- Key changes made:
  - Generated a canvas-based gradient texture (`createGradientTexture`) and keep it assigned to `scene.background` even when HDR env maps load.
  - Rebuilt the reflector + ground plane with brighter colors/metalness; bumped renderer clear color to match.
  - Updated fog color/density and ensured the gradient reappears after PMREM env refreshes.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - Manual `npm run dev` (verify background, fog, and reflections). No automated suite.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - `Canvas gradient fallback → avoids WebGPU-only node background requirements`
  - `Store gradient texture reference → reapply after env map load` so HDR sync doesn’t blank the sky.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - The old env-map load path silently reset `scene.background` to `null`; tracking the texture resolves future regressions.
  - Lightening fog even slightly dramatically improves perceived depth when rooms sit on a reflective plane.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Tie the gradient palette to `SunSkyDome` telemetry so dawn/day/night transitions feel cohesive.
  - Evaluate how the new room raycaster can trigger upcoming “room view” panels.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need telemetry-driven palette/lighting plan (FE-101b) before automating background colors.
