# Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `00:31`
- **End Time**: `00:48`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:17`
- **Working Title**: Legacy sweep & task planning
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-110`, `FE-111`, `FE-112`

## Objectives
- Audit the 3D experience repo for lingering legacy files (old HA dashboard updater, demo scenes, missing imports).
- Identify gaps to feed the next wave of tasks (telemetry-driven gradients, room-view integration).
- Log new tasks so the next agent has a clear queue.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands):
  - `rg` across `src/` for TODOs and unused modules.
  - `src/uiUpdater.js`, `src/ui/components/atoms/main.js`, `src/Setup.js`, `src/scene.js`, `RoomSelectionController`.
- Key changes made:
  - Added FE-110/111/112 tasks to the backlog covering legacy cleanup, sun-driven gradients, and room-view event wiring.
  - Recorded this discovery session so handoff notes include the identified work.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - None (read-only inspection).

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - `Track cleanup + telemetry tasks explicitly → prevents them getting lost behind feature work`
  - `Room selection should emit events → needed for upcoming room-view popovers`
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - `uiUpdater.js` still references `homeAssistant.js` (nonexistent), so it’s a latent crash if reintroduced.
  - The demo Three.js scene under `ui/components/atoms/main.js` duplicates orbit controls and is safe to remove.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Execute FE-110: delete/rewrite the legacy UI files.
  - Tackle FE-111 to tie gradient + HDRI swap directly into SunTelemetry.
  - Implement FE-112 so room selection publishes persona-ready events for the new room-views project.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None; requires engineering bandwidth.
