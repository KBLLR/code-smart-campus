# Working Session

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 10:05
- **End**: 10:22
- **Elapsed**: 00:17
- **Working title**: FE-102 QA harness
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `FE-102`

## Objectives
- Provide a quick way to capture bloom-on/off frames for design review.
- Document the QA process so future runs don’t rely on tribal knowledge.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `src/main.js`
  - `docs/projects/3d-experience/qa/bloom-qa-playbook.md`
- Changes made:
  - Added `scene.userData.postFX.captureSnapshot()` helper to toggle bloom, render once, and optionally download PNGs.
  - Authored the bloom QA playbook outlining capture steps, telemetry notes, and deliverables.
- Commands / tests:
  - _(not run)_ `npm run lint`

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. None; helper relies on existing renderer so it piggybacks on the main loop.
- **Decisions**:
  - Reset renderer size/pixel ratio after snapshots to avoid side effects.
- **Learnings**:
  - With Post FX encapsulated, adding QA utilities is straightforward—keep enriching `scene.userData.postFX` for tooling.

## Next Actions
- Execute the playbook during the next telemetry window and stash screenshots under `qa/screenshots/`.
