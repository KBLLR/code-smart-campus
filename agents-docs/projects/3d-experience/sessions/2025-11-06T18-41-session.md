# Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-06`
- **Start Time**: `18:28`
- **End Time**: `18:41`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:13`
- **Working Title**: Reflective floor + resize hooks
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-101b`, `FE-107`

## Objectives
- Primary goal(s) for this session:
  - Integrate a lightweight reflective ground plane and keep it in sync with renderer resizes.
  - Verify the dusk gradient background survives the new reflection stack.
  - Update shared docs so other agents understand the new scene baseline.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands):
  - `src/Setup.js`
  - `agents-docs/projects/3d-experience/scene-foundation-refresh.md`
- Key changes made:
  - Imported Three’s `Reflector`, created a tinted circular reflector, and hooked it into window resize to keep render targets sharp.
  - Left the renderer on WebGL but feature-detected `navigator.gpu` to log readiness for the future WebGPU migration.
  - Updated the scene foundation doc to capture the reflector addition and WebGPU posture.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - _Manual_: Launched `npm run dev` to confirm gradient + reflection coexist without flashing.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - `Stay on WebGL renderer -> EffectComposer bloom chain still tied to WebGL`
  - `Tinted reflection -> prevents mirrors from overpowering campus lighting`
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Reflector render target size needs manual refresh; tying into resize keeps reflections crisp.
  - Gradient background plays nicely with reflection when `scene.background` stays null.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Assess performance impact once the full campus mesh and HUD overlays are visible.
  - Prep a checklist for migrating post-processing to TSL/WebGPU variants.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Await WebGPU-ready EffectComposer replacement before swapping renderer.
