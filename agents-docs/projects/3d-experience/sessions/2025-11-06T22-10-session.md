# Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-06`
- **Start Time**: `21:35`
- **End Time**: `22:10`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:35`
- **Working Title**: FE-104a room raycasting upgrades
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-104a`

## Objectives
- Wire up a modern selection pipeline so hovering/clicking rooms highlights them and syncs with HUD + camera focus.
- Smooth the highlight animation so emissive changes feel polished instead of snapping.
- Lay the groundwork for upcoming room-specific views by aligning UI hero treatments across experiences.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands):
  - `src/three/RoundedBlockGenerator.js` – store `userData.roomKey` on room meshes.
  - `src/interaction/RoomSelectionController.js` (new) + `src/main.js` wiring.
  - `src/scene.js`, `src/styles/main.css`, `index.html`.
- Key changes made:
  - Added `RoomSelectionController` that subscribes to `RaycasterHandler` events, resolves room → entity mappings, and reuses existing HUD highlight APIs.
  - Animated highlight colors/emissive/brightness for smoother hover-in/out feedback.
  - Introduced the shared hero header + relocated the HA status pill into the sensor dashboard overlay.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - Manual QA via `npm run dev` (hover/click rooms, verify focus + HUD updates).

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - `Leverage existing RaycasterHandler → no need to duplicate picking logic`.
  - `Normalize room IDs once → store on mesh + reuse when matching labels/HUD`.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Label anchors already expose room IDs, so building the resolver map is trivial.
  - Animating emissive intensity drastically improves perceived responsiveness without touching materials.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Add keyboard/controller shortcuts for selection clearing and multi-select modes.
  - Capture automated tests around hover/click events once the room manifest stabilises.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need final requirements for room-specific overlays before adding deeper interactions.
