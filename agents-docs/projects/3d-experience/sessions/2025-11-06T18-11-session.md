# Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-06`
- **Start Time**: `18:05`
- **End Time**: `18:25`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:20`
- **Working Title**: Gradient sky + ground polish
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-101b`, `FE-108a`

## Objectives
- Primary goal(s) for this session:
  - Introduce the Ready Player Me style background shader to the campus scene.
  - Add a lightweight ground plane and grid helper that matches the refreshed orbit controls.
  - Capture the work in the shared agent logs for continuity with the rest of the squad.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands):
  - `src/Setup.js`
  - `agents-docs/projects/3d-experience/sessions`
- Key changes made:
  - Wrapped the scene with a node-based gradient background, with a safe fallback when nodes are unavailable.
  - Added a circular ground plane plus semi-transparent grid helper tied to the scene lifecycle.
  - Logged the activity in the 3D experience project sessions directory for downstream agents.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - _Manual sanity_: verified renderer creation path and doc structure.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - `WebGPU noted but deferred → post-processing stack still depends on WebGL renderer`
  - `Ground plane uses CircleGeometry → avoids harsh grid corners and mirrors RPM aesthetic`
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Node-based `backgroundNode` integrates smoothly provided we null out the classic background.
  - Grid helper materials need manual transparency tweaks to avoid depth conflicts with the new floor.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Investigate reflector implementation once composer pipeline is WebGPU-ready.
  - Revisit orbit presets after the HUD filter API lands.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - EffectComposer (UnrealBloom) still lacks WebGPU parity.
