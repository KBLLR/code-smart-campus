# Working Session

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 09:59
- **End**: 10:18
- **Elapsed**: 00:19
- **Working title**: FE-103 HUD audit & plan
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `FE-103`

## Objectives
- Review the current Three.js sprite-based label system.
- Define the architecture for transitioning to CSS-driven HUD labels.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `src/lib/LabelManager.js`
  - `src/utils/LabelLayoutManager.js`
  - `src/ui/createLabel.js`
  - `src/ui/makeTextTexture.js`
  - `docs/projects/3d-experience/css-hud-plan.md`
  - `docs/projects/3d-experience/tasks.md`
- Changes made:
  - Documented the planned CSS HUD architecture (anchors, projection utility, `CSSHudManager`, DOM overlay) in `css-hud-plan.md`.
  - Updated the FE-103 task entry to reference the new spec and next implementation steps.
- Commands / tests:
  - _(none executed)_

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. None — research & planning session only.
- **Decisions**:
  - Keep Three.js anchors for spatial metadata while moving presentation to a DOM overlay.
  - Stage rollout in phases to keep sprite fallback until CSS HUD passes QA.
- **Learnings**:
  - Existing layout manager can be repurposed to apply classes/modes once HUD is DOM-based.
  - `scene.userData` pattern (used for post FX) will work well for exposing HUD controls/events.

## Next Actions
- Implement `projectWorldToScreen` helper and `CSSHudManager` skeleton.
- Inject label anchors alongside current sprites to validate projection math before full migration.
