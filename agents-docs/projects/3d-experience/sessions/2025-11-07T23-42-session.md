# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `22:05`
- **End Time**: `23:05`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `01:00`
- **Working Title**: `FE-113 renderer-aware UIL`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-113`, `WR-011`

## Objectives
- Ensure the UIL debugger only mounts controls that are valid for the active renderer (WebGL vs WebGPU).

## Execution Notes
- Added helper functions in `src/main.js` (`registerWebGLModules`, `registerWebGPUModules`) and moved the lighting/sun module registration behind a WebGL-only guard.
- Moved the registration call until *after* `scene.userData.postFX` exists, so the lighting module finally receives a live postFX controller.
- WebGPU builds now skip those modules entirely; instead they rely on the projector/UI modules that are already WebGPU-safe.
- Updated docs/tasks earlier to track FE-113/WR-011; this session covers the implementation.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Leave base modules (navigation, debugger, room levels) shared; only the renderer-specific stacks diverge.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Lighting controls were previously init’d before `postFX` even existed, so they were silently broken even in WebGL—guarding + moving the call fixes that too.

## Next Actions
- Build the dedicated WebGPU UIL surface (WR-011 follow-up) with future projector/media controls once the content modules ship.

## Session Quote
- > “If the renderer can’t honor a control, don’t render the control.”

## Post Image Prompt
```
A control panel that forks into two colored branches—one labeled WebGL with bloom sliders, the other WebGPU with projector knobs—only one branch lit at a time.
```
