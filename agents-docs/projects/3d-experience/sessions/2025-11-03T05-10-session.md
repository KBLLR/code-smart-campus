# Working Session

Use this **for every working session** (coding, design, refactor, infra). One file per block.

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 05:10
- **End**: 05:18
- **Elapsed**: 00:08
- **Working title**: FE-101b sun path arc
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `FE-101b`

## Objectives
- Visualise the recent trajectory of the sun within the scene.
- Feed telemetry samples into a reusable path component.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `src/lib/SunTelemetry.js`
  - `src/scene.js`
- Changes made:
  - Added `SunTelemetry.getSamples()` to expose recent buffered data.
  - Implemented `SunPathArc` (line geometry) and registered it in the scene.
  - Path updates on each telemetry refresh using SunController’s position math.
- Commands / tests:
  - *(visual feature — manual verification pending preview)*

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. None—line geometry handled the sample subset cleanly.
- **Decisions**:
  - Limited arc history to 96 points to avoid overdraw while keeping a smooth curve.
- **Learnings**:
  - Reusing SunController’s `computeSunPosition` prevented duplicated spherical math.

## Next Actions
- Evaluate arc visibility at night; may fade out below horizon in a later pass.
- Consider small glow sprites along the path to highlight key sun events.
