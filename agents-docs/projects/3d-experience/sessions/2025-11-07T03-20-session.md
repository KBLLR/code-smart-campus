# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `02:50`
- **End Time**: `03:20`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:30`
- **Working Title**: `FE-114 reusable hero`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `FE-114`

## Objectives
- Extract the static hero banner from `index.html` into a reusable component other views can reuse.
- Hook the component into the data pipeline so HA connection status updates the status pill.
- Keep styling centralized so future pages can import the same glassmorphic hero.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `index.html`, `src/main.js`, `src/styles/main.css`, `src/ui/components/molecules/ViewHero.js`, `agents-docs/projects/3d-experience/tasks.md`.
- Key changes:
  - Added the `ViewHero` molecule with an API for eyebrow/title/subtitle/status updates and mounted it inside `#ui-shell`.
  - Replaced the hard-coded markup in `index.html` with a root container and instantiated the component from `src/main.js`, tying its status to `dataPipeline` socket events.
  - Extended the stylesheet with tone-aware status pills plus default typography, then logged FE-114 as done in the task ledger.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - _Not run_ (DOM-only change; verified visually in dev server earlier).

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  1. None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Kept the hero as a lightweight class instead of a Web Component to avoid extra polyfills and keep API familiar to the rest of the codebase.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - The data pipeline already exposes socket lifecycle events, making it straightforward to piggyback the hero status on that telemetry.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - FE-115: wire or retire `src/ui/uiUpdater.js` so HUD + dashboard stay in sync.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None for FE-115; HA tunnel work tracked separately in the new HA project.
