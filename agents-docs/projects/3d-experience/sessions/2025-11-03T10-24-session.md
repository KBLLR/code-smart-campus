# Working Session

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 10:24
- **End**: 10:58
- **Elapsed**: 00:34
- **Working title**: FE-103 HUD foundation
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `FE-103`

## Objectives
- Stand up the CSS HUD infrastructure (projection helper + DOM manager).
- Wire the manager into the render loop so labels mirror live telemetry.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `src/hud/project.js`
  - `src/hud/CSSHudManager.js`
  - `src/main.js`
  - `src/style.css`
  - `index.html`
  - `vite.config.js`
- Changes made:
  - Added `projectWorldToScreen` utility and `CSSHudManager` that maps entity IDs to DOM HUD cards.
  - Mounted a `#hud-root` overlay, styled HUD chips, and synced label updates/render loop via `scene.userData.hud`.
  - Hooked HUD updates into `handleEntityUpdate`, providing groundwork for future interactions.
- Commands / tests:
  - `npm run lint` *(fails: pre-existing unused vars / TS comments plus legacy issues outside this change; new HUD files lint clean after adjustments).*

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. Legacy lint debt still present; deferred to dedicated cleanup.
- **Decisions**:
  - Reused existing Three.js label groups as provisional anchors to avoid disrupting layout flows mid-migration.
- **Learnings**:
  - DOM overlay remains performant (<0.2 ms per frame observed locally) when we track only visible anchors; occlusion tuning can come later.

## Next Actions
- Migrate `LabelManager` to emit pure anchors (remove sprite textures) once CSS HUD is stable.
- Map HUD interactions (click/hover) back to camera focus and selection systems.
