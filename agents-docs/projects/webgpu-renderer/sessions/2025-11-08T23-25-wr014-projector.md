# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 23:05
- **End Time**: 23:25
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:20
- **Working Title**: WR-014 projector bootstrap
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: WR-014

## Objectives
- Instantiate the WebGPU projector as part of core scene setup so it’s visible immediately.
- Expose capability flags + debugger controls for the projector.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `src/main.js`, `src/ui/modules/DebuggerControls.js`.
- Key changes made:
  - Added `bootstrapProjector()` so the projector initializes as soon as WebGPU mode is active (and retargets once `roundedRoomsGroup` loads). Capability flags and `scene.userData.projector` are set immediately.
  - Passed the projector light into the debugger module via a new `extraEntries` hook so users can select/focus it like any other room.
  - Reused the same helper when WebGPU room geometry resolves; `projector-ready` events still fire for UI listeners.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Having the debugger treat projector as a selectable node proved easy once the control supported extras.

## Next Actions
- Follow up with WR-010 (projector parameter API) to expose intensity/penumbra sliders in UIL.
