# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `15:30`
- **End Time**: `15:40`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:10`
- **Working Title**: `WebGPU charter refresh`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `WR-002`, `WR-006`, `WR-007`

## Objectives
- Update the WebGPU project scope to reflect TSL shader research + ML possibilities.
- Seed backlog items for room-specific TSL work and future WebGPU ML staging.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `agents-docs/projects/webgpu-renderer/README.md`, `tasks.md`.
- Expanded the charter to mention TSL shading for rooms and the opportunity to host ML workloads once WebGPU is live.
- Added two backlog tasks:
  - `WR-006` for room material TSL research (with required search terms).
  - `WR-007` for a WebGPU ML staging plan (compute shaders, occupancy inference).
- Logged this planning session for posterity.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Keep TSL/ML work inside this project so renderer constraints are handled by the same team.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - The existing README already hinted at advanced effects; clarifying ML support should keep future efforts aligned.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Start WR-006 research to unblock shader experimentation.
  - Outline WR-007 once we confirm WebGPU compute requirements with the data-pipeline crew.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need up-to-date Three.js WebGPU samples for TSL references.

## Session Quote
- > "WebGPU is not just a renderer—it’s our GPU workbench for visuals and intelligence."
