# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `18:55`
- **End Time**: `19:45`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:50`
- **Working Title**: `WR-008 projector prototype`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `WR-008`

## Objectives
- Bring the WebGPU-only projector light online using Three's `ProjectorLight` so we can project HUD/media patterns onto the campus.
- Ensure the projector only runs when the WebGPU renderer is active and cleans up cleanly.

## Execution Notes
- Added `src/three/WebGPUProjector.js` which creates a CanvasTexture grid, instantiates `ProjectorLight`, and keeps a helper plane aimed at the target. Exposed `updateTarget()` + `dispose()`.
- `main.js` now instantiates the projector once `roundedRoomsGroup` resolves (WebGPU only) and stores it under `scene.userData.projector` for future controls. The render loop also got a `rendererReady` await earlier (from the previous session) so we use that to guard initial render.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None. Projector renders as expected in WebGPU mode.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Generate the projection texture procedurally so we didn’t have to add new assets; easy to swap later.
  - Reuse the rounded room group’s bounding box to position the projection target automatically.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - `ProjectorLight` will happily render without shadows; no extra node plumbing needed beyond setting `light.map`.

## Next Actions
- Add UIL controls to steer the projector (toggle, color, texture swap) in a later pass.
- Consider tying projector content to live sensor dashboards (videos, occupancy heatmaps).

## Session Quote
- > “The campus finally has a holographic projector, even if it’s ‘just’ a glorified spotlight for now.”
