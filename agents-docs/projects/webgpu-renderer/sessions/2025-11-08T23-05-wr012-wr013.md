# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 22:20
- **End Time**: 23:05
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:45
- **Working Title**: WR-012 & WR-013 research
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: WR-012, WR-013

## Objectives
- Document WebGPU fundamentals (API scope, benefits, implications) for future renderer decisions.
- Capture Three.js r181 TSL/material compatibility + limitations for the WebGPU path.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `agents-docs/projects/webgpu-renderer/research/WR-012-webgpu-overview.md`, `.../WR-013-tsl-materials.md`, `tasks.md`.
- Key changes made:
  - Authored WR-012 overview summarizing WebGPU’s design, solved problems, migration steps, and Smart Campus implications.
  - Wrote WR-013 notes covering TSL node material support, shader pitfalls, and recommendations for porting remaining GLSL.
  - Marked WR-012 and WR-013 as “Done” in the task ledger.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - _n/a (documentation-only)_

## Reflection
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Reminder that any lingering `ShaderMaterial` will block WebGPU; we need a proper TSL migration plan (tie-in to WR-006/WR-011).
  - Compute shader opportunities (WR-007) hinge on WGSL adoption; we should start designing buffer layouts now.

## Next Actions
- Feed findings into WR-003/WR-006 planning (port remaining materials, ensure capability flags).
- Kick off WR-004 or WR-007 once bootstrap stabilizes.
