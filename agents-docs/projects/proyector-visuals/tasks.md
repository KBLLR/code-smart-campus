## Backlog
| ID | Title | Description | Priority | Owner | Notes |
|----|-------|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| PV-101 | Camera/projector helper gizmo | Add Three.js helpers to visualize projector frustums + allow interactive positioning (inspired by “camera helpers” from three docs). | High | Codex | Needed to place projectors accurately. |
| PV-102 | Texture atlas broadcaster | Load `public/textureAtlas.webp` and expose UI slots to pick which tile projects onto a room. | High | Codex | Enables quick iteration on imagery. |
| PV-103 | Notification/highlight patterns | Design projector sequences for alerts (e.g., red pulses on a room) and tie them to sensor events. | Medium | Codex | Requires HA event hooks. |
| PV-104 | Video-mapped dashboards | Investigate projecting live dashboards/app views onto room surfaces (video textures). | Medium | Codex | Coordinate with WR-009. |
| PV-105 | Multi-projector orchestration | Explore how multiple lights can collaborate (cross-fades, layered info). | Low | Codex | Future concept once single projector solid. |
