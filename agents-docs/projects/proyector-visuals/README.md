# Proyector Visuals Lab

Design and prototype immersive projector effects for the 3D campus: aesthetic washes, data overlays, notification beams, and multi-projector systems that react to live telemetry.

## Charter
- Experiment with WebGPU projector lights (`WebGPUProjector`) to display useful info on rooms (sensor heatmaps, alerts, app previews).
- Treat projections as both art direction and UI (highlight entrances, broadcast notifications, video-map dashboards onto surfaces).
- Build reusable helpers (camera/projector gizmos, atlas loaders) so other projects can drop in projector scenes quickly.

## Artifacts
- `tasks.md` — backlog using `PV-XXX` IDs.
- `sessions/` — experiments, shader tests, UX studies.
- `future-features/` — doc ideas for multi-projector orchestration, scheduling, etc.
