# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 19:30
- **End Time**: 19:50
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:20
- **Working Title**: Slider panel layout planning
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: UX-107, UX-108, UX-109

## Objectives
- Capture the refined 3-row slider panel layout (header/nav, two-column page body, footer) so implementation tasks are clear.
- Break the requirements into actionable backlog items under the UIX project.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `agents-docs/projects/uix/tasks.md`, new session log.
- Key updates:
  - Added UX-107 (header nav rail), UX-108 (info/action two-column layout), and UX-109 (footer + motion polish) to the backlog with descriptions referencing the spec.
  - Documented the desired proportions (top header 100%, mid body 30/70 split, footer TBD) plus spacing/margin expectations.
  - Noted animation + responsiveness needs (graceful slide, generous padding, icon separators, off-white icon palette).
- Tests / commands executed: _n/a (planning only)_

## Reflection
- **Decisions Taken**: Treat header/nav, mid content, and footer/motion as separate tasks so we can parallelize work without muddling ownership.
- **Learnings & Surprises**: The page description paragraph is a useful spot to set expectations—will need content inputs once we know the final action sets.

## Next Actions
- UX-107: Prototype the new header bar (icon nav, separators, pagination indicator) and wire it to existing tab/page logic.
- UX-108: Restructure the page body to render the info column + action grid per spec, adjusting typography/padding.
- UX-109: Define footer content plus slide animations/easing curves; ensure responsive breakpoints feel great on touch + desktop.
