# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 22:20
- **End Time**: 22:35
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:15
- **Working Title**: Carousel container + indicators
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: UX-107

## Objectives
- Ensure the HA carousel container matches the height of the `hui-panel` cards (no clipping / fixed max-height).
- Position the pagination indicators directly beneath the carousel, centered.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `src/styles/main.css`.
- Key changes made:
  - Reworked `.panel-shell` into a flex column (centered) so the carousel and indicators stack vertically with a small gap; `.panel-strip` stays relative, indicator nav sits just below.
  - Removed the `max-height:260px` clamp on `#content-area` so it grows to the panels’ natural 240px height.
  - Centered `.panel-indicators` and tweaked spacing.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Using flex column for `.panel-shell` keeps future footer/motion work straightforward.

## Next Actions
- Verify in the scene that the deck is centered and visible above the dock; continue UX-109 afterwards.
