# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 20:25
- **End Time**: 20:40
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:15
- **Working Title**: Header dock & icon pass
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: UX-107

## Objectives
- Move the page navigation rail into the slider header so icons remain visible when the panel is collapsed (dock-like behavior).
- Standardize nav icon sizing and tint to the requested off-white palette.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `src/ui/components/organisms/Toolbar.js`, `src/styles/main.css`.
- Key changes made:
  - Rendered the nav rail directly inside the panel header and exposed `renderHeaderNav`, ensuring the dock stays visible when the body is hidden.
  - Enlarged nav buttons (48px tiles, 28px icons) with separators, indicator text, and refined filters for an off-white look.
  - Updated collapsed-state styles so only the body hides; header/nav remain accessible.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Cached nav buttons via `this.navButtons` to keep state toggling simple.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - The dock aesthetic makes the collapsed panel feel intentional rather than truncated.

## Next Actions
- UX-109: bring footer content + motion polish online.
