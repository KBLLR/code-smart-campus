# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 18:20
- **End Time**: 19:20
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 01:00
- **Working Title**: Sliding panel column layout
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: UX-103, UX-106

## Objectives
- Turn the toolbar sheet into a proper UIX template with three-column framing and richer header metadata.
- Add pagination headers + eyebrow/title/subtitle stack so every tab communicates its context.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `src/ui/components/organisms/Toolbar.js`, `src/styles/main.css`, `agents-docs/projects/uix/*`.
- Key changes made:
  - Introduced TAB metadata (eyebrow/title/subtitle/pages) and piped every builder through a shared skeleton that renders pagination controls plus headings.
  - Rebuilt the panel body with a 10/80/10 column grid, left/right gutters, and a padded center column that hosts tab content.
  - Updated button/icon styling to off-white tones, exposed labels under icons, and added lazy header rows for each tab.
  - Renamed the project to **UIX** and migrated tasks/sessions/README to the new scope.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None—mostly structural work.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Keep pagination buttons present (but disabled) so later multi-page grids can hook in without reworking the DOM.
  - Cache tab DOM fragments to avoid rebuilding large button grids on every switch.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - The 10/80/10 grid gives breathing room for future ambient info (legends, alerts) without crowding the main column.
  - Pulling icon/label metadata from TAB config keeps the panel ready for future templating.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - UX-106: Populate the pagination row with live page counts + HUD telemetry once available.
  - UX-104: Slot the avatar/action menu into the header once the data contract (UX-102) lands.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Awaiting UX-102 API contract for menu + remote action registration.
