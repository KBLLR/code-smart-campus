# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 22:05
- **End Time**: 22:20
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:15
- **Working Title**: Carousel centering fix
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: UX-107

## Objectives
- Ensure the HA carousel truly floats in the viewport center (no longer tied to the old panel-shell transform).
- Remove the temporary hero background so it sits cleanly over the scene.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point: `src/styles/main.css`.
- Key changes made:
  - Rebuilt `.panel-shell` to cover the entire viewport (flex-centered) and let `.panel-strip` sit relative inside it; no more translate-from-bottom logic.
  - Hero background/border/shadow removed for now (transparent overlay only).
  - Collapsed dock tweaks from the previous session maintained.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Keeping `.panel-shell` as the single positioning layer simplifies future motion work.

## Next Actions
- Confirm on-device that the carousel now overlays the dock; proceed to UX-109 to animate open/close states.
