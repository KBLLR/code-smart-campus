# Session Log

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `14:31`
- **End Time**: `14:35`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:04`
- **Working Title**: `UIX project kickoff`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `UX-101`, `UX-102`

## Objectives
- Clone the project template to spin up the Toolbar initiative.
- Capture initial charter + backlog so other agents can engage immediately.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `agents-docs/templates/project-template`, new `agents-docs/projects/uix` directory.
- Duplicated the template, rewrote the README with scope (shared toolbar shell, avatar actions) per stakeholder ask.
- Seeded `tasks.md` with research + implementation backlog, each tagged with the required pre-task web searches.
- Logged this session for traceability.

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Use `UX-*` IDs for this project to keep naming consistent with other UI/experience initiatives.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - Template already includes session guidance, so onboarding new collaborators will be straightforward.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Start UX-101 research to lock in layout patterns.
  - Draft the toolbar data contract (UX-102) so other projects know how to publish state.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - Need HA user profile/connection API details from the data-pipeline project.
