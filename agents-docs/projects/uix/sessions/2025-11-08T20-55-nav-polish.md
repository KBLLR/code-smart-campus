# Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-08
- **Start Time**: 20:40
- **End Time**: 20:55
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: 00:15
- **Working Title**: Dock polish + icon pass
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: UX-107, UX-108

## Objectives
- Finish the dock look/feel: larger off-white icons, centered nav, and removal of the old indicator/collapse button.
- Tighten the page layout (padding, info typography, action grid limits) per the latest spec.

## Execution Notes
- Entry points: `src/ui/components/organisms/Toolbar.js`, `src/styles/main.css`.
- Key changes made:
  - Nav rail now uses 56px tiles with 34px monochrome icons (ai/settings/news icons wired to `ai.svg`, `adjustments-code.svg`, `book.svg`). Backgrounds were removed so the dock reads clean when collapsed.
  - Added AI/Settings/News tab metadata + placeholders to keep routing intact.
  - Page content gained extra padding, the info-title uses a responsive `clamp`, and the action grid is a 5-column max layout with responsive fallbacks.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `pnpm run lint`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**: None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Keep the nav indicator out for now to avoid clutter; we can reintroduce telemetry later if needed.

## Next Actions
- UX-109: finalize footer content + slide animations.
