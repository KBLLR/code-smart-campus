### Good State - Ready to Resume
***==========================================================================
This document outlines the criteria and steps necessary to ensure that the Smart Campus Live Integration project is in a good state and ready to resume development or deployment activities.
==========================================================================***
### Criteria for Good State
***--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Code Quality**: The codebase should be clean, well-documented, and free of critical bugs. All code should adhere to established coding standards and best practices.
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests should be in place, with a high percentage of code coverage. All tests should pass successfully.
3. **Dependencies**: All project dependencies should be up-to-date and compatible with each other. There should be no known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
4. **Documentation**: All necessary documentation, including setup guides, API documentation, and user manuals, should be complete and up-to-date.
5. **Infrastructure**: The development and production environments should be stable and properly configured. Any required infrastructure components should be operational.
6. **Version Control**: The project should be under version control, with a clear branching strategy in place. The main branch should be stable and ready for deployment.
7. **Stakeholder Alignment**: All stakeholders should be aligned on the project goals, timelines, and deliverables. Any outstanding issues or concerns should be addressed.

***--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Steps to Achieve Good State
***--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Code Review**: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and address any issues related to code quality and adherence to standards.

2. **Testing**: Implement or update tests to ensure comprehensive coverage. Use automated testing tools to run tests regularly and ensure they pass.

3. **Dependency Management**: Use dependency management tools to check for outdated or vulnerable packages. Update dependencies as needed and test for compatibility.

4. **Documentation Update**: Review and update all project documentation to ensure it is accurate and complete. Involve team members in the documentation process to capture all necessary information.

5. **Infrastructure Check**: Review the configuration and status of development and production environments. Address any issues related to stability or configuration.

6. **Version Control Practices**: Ensure that the version control system is properly set up, with clear guidelines for branching and merging. Conduct a final review of the main branch to ensure stability.
