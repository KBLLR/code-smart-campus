# Working Session

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 13:28
- **End**: 13:56
- **Elapsed**: 00:28
- **Working title**: FE-103 anchor bridge
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `FE-103`

## Objectives
- Replace sprite-only labels with reusable anchor objects so the CSS HUD can track them.
- Keep legacy sprite workflow alive for LayoutManager until we fully migrate.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `src/lib/LabelManager.js`
  - `src/main.js`
  - `src/styles/main.css`
  - `docs/projects/3d-experience/css-hud-plan.md`
- Changes made:
  - `LabelManager` now creates and caches lightweight `Object3D` anchors alongside sprites, updates their metadata, and exposes `getAnchors()/getAnchor()`.
  - `main.js` instantiates `CSSHudManager`, syncs anchors, updates HUD cards on entity updates, and advances them each frame.
  - HUD docs updated: marked the anchor migration milestone complete.
- Commands / tests:
  - `npm run lint` *(fails: pre-existing unused-variable debt across legacy files).*

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. None during implementation; HUD synced correctly after the new anchor map.
- **Decisions**:
  - Retained sprites temporarily so existing layout/heatmap flows keep working while HUD migrates.
- **Learnings**:
  - Keeping anchors in the scene graph means we get free world transforms for HUD projections without altering LabelLayoutManager yet.

## Next Actions
- Remove sprite-specific update paths once HUD interactions are wired and QA approves.
