# Working Session

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 12:56
- **End**: 13:18
- **Elapsed**: 00:22
- **Working title**: HUD canvas style lift
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `FE-103`

## Objectives
- Restore the atmospheric styling that was lost when we moved CSS into the Tailwind pipeline.
- Ensure toolbar, panels, and HUD overlays look polished and match the dark-glass motif.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `src/styles/main.css`
  - `src/main.js`
- Changes made:
  - Added background gradients, glassmorphism, and toolbar/panel styling to the consolidated Tailwind-friendly stylesheet.
  - Set the DOM overlay to be pointer-transparent by default while re-enabling hover/interaction on toolbar/panels.
  - Imported the updated stylesheet via the new `@/styles/main.css` entry point.
- Commands / tests:
  - `npm run lint` *(fails: legacy unused-variable debt unrelated to this change).*

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. None; purely visual adjustments.
- **Decisions**:
  - Declared CSS variables and the radial gradient background in `:root`/`body` so future Tailwind classes can reference them.
- **Learnings**:
  - Keeping HUD and panel glass styles in a central stylesheet makes it easier to iterate while we layer in Tailwind utilities later.

## Next Actions
- Revisit toolbar layout (move to lateral dock/top bar) per UI project once HUD migration is stable.
