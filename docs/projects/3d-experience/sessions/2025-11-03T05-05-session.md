# Working Session

Use this **for every working session** (coding, design, refactor, infra). One file per block.

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 05:05
- **End**: 05:06
- **Elapsed**: 00:01
- **Working title**: FE-101b sky dome prototype
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `FE-101b`

## Objectives
- Design a sky dome driven by sun telemetry for dawn/day/night gradients.
- Integrate the dome into the scene update loop alongside SunController.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `src/lib/SunTelemetry.js`
  - `src/lib/SunController.js`
  - `src/scene.js`
- Changes made:
  - Added `SunSkyDome` shader mesh with day/night blending and sun glow.
  - Hooked dome updates to telemetry pipeline and bootstrapped default state.
- Commands / tests:
  - *(none for this visual iteration)*

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. None; shader compiled first try thanks to simple gradient logic.
- **Decisions**:
  - Kept fragment shader minimal (sun dot^12) to avoid overexposing horizon without HDR.
- **Learnings**:
  - Reusing telemetry azimuth/elevation made the dome update trivial—no extra math.

## Next Actions
- Adjust gradient colour palette once we observe real-time values.
- Consider exposing uniforms for designers via Tweakpane.
