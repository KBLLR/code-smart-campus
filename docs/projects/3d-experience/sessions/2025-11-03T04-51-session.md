# Working Session

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 04:51
- **End**: 05:05
- **Elapsed**: 00:14
- **Working title**: FE-101 planning & task breakdown
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `FE-101`

## Objectives
- Review the current `SunController` implementation and identify capability gaps.
- Break FE-101 into actionable sub-tasks with clear dependencies.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `src/lib/SunController.js`
  - `docs/projects/3d-experience/tasks.md`
- Changes made:
  - Audited current sun handling (single directional light, no interpolation, no sky visuals).
  - Added backlog rows FE-101a/b/c to capture solar ingest, sky dome, and moon workstreams.
  - Documented that FE-101a is prerequisite for FE-101b/c via task notes.
- Commands / tests:
  - *(none — planning/documentation session)*

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. Noticed HA updates can arrive sporadically; will need interpolation and fallback defaults during cloudy data gaps.
- **Decisions**:
  - Prioritised building a clean telemetry ingest layer (FE-101a) before any visual polish to avoid rework.
- **Learnings**:
  - Existing SunController already encapsulates light/sphere but lacks persistence of last known state; will extend during FE-101a.

## Next Actions
- Kick off FE-101a: design smoothing utility + unit tests around sample sun data.
- Gather requirements for moon data source (HA vs astronomical library) to scope FE-101c.
