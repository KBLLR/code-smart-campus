# Working Session

Use this **for every working session** (coding, design, refactor, infra). One file per block.

## Session Summary
- **Date**: 2025-11-03
- **Start**: 05:50
- **End**: 05:58
- **Elapsed**: 00:08
- **Working title**: Data pipeline scaffolding kickoff
- **Associated tasks / issues**: `DP-101`, `FF-001`

## Objectives
- Stand up the data pipeline documentation space and backlog.
- Capture the solar event feed feature to support 3D sun markers.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files / scripts):
  - `docs/projects/template/`
  - `docs/templates/future-feature.md`
- Changes made:
  - Created `docs/projects/data-pipeline/` with charter, task ledger, sessions README, and future-features folder.
  - Logged DP-106 (Solar Event Feed) and authored FF-001 spec describing the daily ephemeris export.
- Commands / tests:
  - `date -u` (timestamp reference)

## Reflection
- **Errors / blockers**:
  1. None—docs-only setup.
- **Decisions**:
  - Positioned the solar event feed as a medium-priority backlog item since it unlocks sun markers in 3D.
- **Learnings**:
  - Keeping FF docs co-located with projects clarifies ownership across teams.

## Next Actions
- Flesh out DP-101 scope (schema + validation) before implementation begins.
- Coordinate with 3D team to define required fields in the solar event output.
